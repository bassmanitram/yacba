## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Lazy Loading Pattern
```python
def lazy_import_strands():
    """Lazy import of strands library."""
    def _import():
        from strands import Agent
        return Agent
    return lazy_importer.get_module('strands_agent', _import)
```

### Caching Pattern
```python
@cached_operation("tool_discovery")
def discover_tool_configs(directory):
    # Expensive operation cached automatically
    return expensive_computation(directory)
```

### Performance Monitoring Pattern
```python
@timed_operation("startup")
def startup_function():
    with perf_monitor.time_operation("sub_operation"):
        # Automatically timed and tracked
        pass
```

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

### CLI Arguments (Future Enhancement)
- `--clear-cache` - Clear performance cache
- `--show-perf-stats` - Display performance statistics
- `--disable-cache` - Disable caching for debugging
- `--perf-log-level` - Set performance logging level

### Environment Variables
- `YACBA_CACHE_DIR` - Custom cache directory
- `YACBA_DISABLE_LAZY_LOADING` - Disable lazy loading
- `YACBA_PERF_MONITORING` - Enable/disable monitoring
